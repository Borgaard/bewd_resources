How to fix errors
----

* When you encounter a problem, first read the error. Often error messages will give you a hint about what went wrong, where it went wrong, and how to fix it.

* Chances are someone else has encountered the same problem you're experiencing. Check [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) where developers post errors they've run into, and other developers help troubleshoot.

* For Ruby-specific questions, [OmniRef](https://www.omniref.com/) is an excellent resource.

* If you're unable to find your problem on Google, Stack Overflow nor Omniref, ask a friend or classmate. They may be experiencing the same issue and you can solve it together.

* Experts in Awesome are available in class, during office hours and for quick questions on Slack.
