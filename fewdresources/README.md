If you've found this readme, please send Nicole cute cat pictures. Thanks!

Please note: the resources listed here are _not part of General Assembly's curriculum_ and should not be considered so. They are entirely independently aggregated materials Nicole finds to be useful to _anyone_ learning web development. You can find the [back end version here](https://github.com/Borgaard/bewd11-homework/tree/master/NicoleBorgaard-Borgaard).

If you'd like to contribute a resource you think is helpful to learning web development, that is _awesome_ :octocat: and I ask that you please submit a pull request.
